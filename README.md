# Garnet

Garnet is a TUI gemini client with a focus on three major features:

* First-class Windows support
* Easy localization
* Bein' Pretty (even with languages that aren't Latin-based)
  * First class support for RTL/BiDi (not implemented)
  * First class support for wide characters (CJK) (not implemented)

Currently, it's in heavy development, and is still only a CLI client.
